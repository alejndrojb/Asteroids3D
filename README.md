**Description** 

This is a spin off the classic arcade game Asteroids. This game features an immersive 3D space environment where the player will control a spaceship and use lasers to destroy asteroids or enemy ships while avoiding collisions with them. The objective is to accumulate points and survive as long as possible. The player will have five lives and will lose a life if their spaceship collides with an asteroid. If they lose all five lives, the game is over. As the player progresses, the game will become more challenging with faster asteroids and more obstacles to avoid.
